# Video

OpenGolfSim can use one or more connected webcams to automatically record short video clips of your shots and even provide on-screen instant replay.

## Webcam Compatibility

Virtually any standard PC webcam that connects over USB should be supported. As long as your system sees it as a web camera.

## Settings

You can configure some basic settings to fine tune your video recordings. 

- **Memory Length:** The number of seconds of video to keep in-memory for video recordings (default is 10 seconds). When a shot data is detected, we'll cut a new video clip with this recording length. If you find that the start of your swing is being cut off, you can increase this value to capture more video for each shot. Alternatively, if you find you have too much lead time in your videos, you can reduce the memory length.

- **Framerate:** The number of frames per second (FPS) to capture for video clips. This will depend on your web camera's capability. Note: Higher frame-rate captures will require more system resources, possibly causing slower gameplay. Consider a max frame rate of <= 30 FPS, unless you have a very powerful PC.
