# Connecting GSPro

### Step 1

Open **GSPro** and select **GSPro Connect API** as your Launch Monitor source.

### Step 2

Start the game from the GSPro Launch Menu, and the **APIv1 Connect** window should open as well.

| GSPro                                                   | Connect API                                             |

{: .note }

> If GSPro opened in fullscreen, and you don't see the other windows, you can press `F11` to toggle GSPro into windowed mode.

### Step 3

If everything went ok, both the **GSPro APIv1 Connect** and **Connect R10** app should now indicate they are connected.

{: .note }

> It shouldn't matter which order you launch GSPro or the **Connect R10** app, but there's a bug with **APIv1 Connect**, where it won't reestablish a connection if the **Connect R10** application exits. If you find your self unable to send shot data, simply restart the GSPro or the **APIv1 Connect** application to reconnect.
